There is no central script guiding events toward comfort or resolution. Actions persist. Loss carries forward. The world remembers what you did, what you failed to do, and who you chose to rely on.</p> <p>Exploration is slow and deliberate. You move through settlements, ruins, wilderness, and contested spaces as an observer first and an actor second, learning the world through fragments, reactions, and pressure rather than exposition. Information is incomplete by design. Comprehension comes from paying attention, returning changed, and surviving long enough to recognize patterns.</p> <p>Over time, you gather allies. Not recruits to optimize, but people with limits, histories, and ways of acting in the world. You may travel with many, but only a few can fight at your side at any given moment. Choosing who stands together is as important as how they act once combat begins.</p> <p>Combat is turn-based and unforgiving, emphasizing preparation, positioning, and coherence over reflex. Encounters are not solved through repetition alone. They are puzzles that ask different questions as the game progresses. Early on, flexibility matters. Later, understanding matters more. Certain enemies can only be overcome by specific combinations of roles, capabilities, and tolerances. Toward the end, victory may require not just the right strategy, but the right people.</p> <p>Progression is not about becoming safe. It is about becoming capable. Characters begin fragile and uncertain, relying on restraint, improvisation, and one another. Capability emerges through loss, adaptation, and learning what fits together under pressure. Power is never free, and specialization closes as many doors as it opens.</p> <p>You act through compassion, will, or insight. These are not moral choices presented as answers, but interpretive lenses through which the world responds. Allies react. Factions shift indirectly. Consequences surface late, unevenly, and sometimes far from where they were set in motion.</p> <p>Logistics are handled quietly. Resources are gathered, interpreted, and transformed through others, not through inventory management or personal mastery. What matters is less about how or what you collected but more to do with what the world can trade or craft with what you found.</p> <p>Ash &amp; Light is not a game about clean victories or optimal paths. It is about endurance, composition, and learning how to exist in a world that does not explain itself, but responds honestly to those who remain.</p>"},{"location":"02_playing_a_character/02_playing_a_character/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>PLAYING A CHARACTER</p> <p>Playing a character in Ash &amp; Light means taking a position in the world and accepting the limits and possibilities that come with it. Types, classes, and alignment shape how a character approaches danger, cooperation, belief, and compromise. They influence what feels natural, what feels costly, and what remains possible when circumstances tighten. A character is both a set of abilities and a point of view, carrying strengths, blind spots, and tendencies that affect how situations unfold and how consequences are lived through.</p>"},{"location":"02_playing_a_character/03_types/","title":"Types","text":"<p>Types</p> <p>Types define a character\u2019s nature and origin within the world of Ash &amp; Light. Each Type reflects how a being came to exist, whether through lineage, transformation, technology, anomaly, or survival across eras. Types shape inherent strengths, weaknesses, and special traits, influencing how characters interact with the world and its systems. A Type does not dictate morality, profession, or role in combat, but establishes the fundamental condition from which all paths and classes emerge.</p> <p>Alien</p> <p>First known contact came from the Betelgeuse system during the Expansions Era (23rd century), when coalitions between species began to form. The Alien\u2019s mastery of subatomic matter and superior intellect make them formidable opponents, often winning through strategy and the careful reading of an enemy\u2019s rhythm. Their detached logic inspires admiration in some and unease in others, as their decisions often feel precise rather than compassionate. Particularity: Can teleport (with a cooldown) Diet: Very selective, eats little, consumes electricity to maintain humanoid form Weakness: Poison damage \u00d71.5; healing received \u00d70.9</p> <p>Ascendant</p> <p>Born of human origin, the Ascendant awakened during the Triggers Era (22nd century) as new visions and teachings revealed the deeper laws of the world. Through meditation and tireless training, they transcended common limits, achieving balance and unmatched adaptability in battle. They are often welcomed openly, though their certainty can quietly unsettle those who distrust revelation over proof. Particularity: Attribute total \u00d71.2 Diet: Omnivore Weakness: None</p> <p>Cyborg</p> <p>Engineered through early A.I. experiments of the Triggers Era and refined during the Expansions, Cyborgs combine human instinct with technological resilience. Their advanced optics pierce barriers, and their endurance allows them to outlast nearly any foe. Their reliability earns trust in moments of crisis, yet their dependence on machinery leaves others wondering where the human ends. Particularity: Can see through walls (with a cooldown) Diet: Omnivore, also consumes electricity Weakness: Electric damage \u00d71.75</p> <p>Descendant</p> <p>Born when divine lineage resurfaced during the Triggers Era, Descendants carry traces of forgotten gods within mortal flesh. Their strength and resistance to pain surpass ordinary beings, and each channels a fragment of the power once belonging to their ancestral deity. Their presence commands respect by default, though it rarely invites ease or familiarity. Particularity: Power depends on chosen god Diet: Omnivore Weakness: Determined by chosen god</p> <p>Dwarf</p> <p>Hidden through the Unknowns Era (19th\u201320th centuries) and rediscovered during the Expansions, Dwarves brought back their immense strength and deep-rooted craft. Descendants of ancient Neanderthal lines, they stand immovable on the battlefield and unshaken in purpose. Their constancy earns long-term trust, even when their stubbornness tests patience. Particularity: Cannot be physically destabilized; smaller than average Diet: Omnivore, eats heavily Weakness: Agility \u00d70.85</p> <p>Elf</p> <p>Withdrawn through the Unknowns and Warnings Eras (19th\u201321st centuries), Elves emerged again after the Fracture to aid in rebuilding. Ageless and precise, they move with natural harmony, their kinship with living things often turning the wild itself into an ally. Their restraint and distance are admired by some and mistaken for indifference by others. Particularity: Can command visible animals Diet: Elven food Weakness: Experience gained \u00d70.85</p> <p>Mutant</p> <p>Born from clandestine human experiments of the Warnings Era (21st century), Mutants awakened to psychic power that blurred the line between thought and action. They dominate subtle battlefields, reading or bending minds before a single strike is made. Feared more for what they can influence than what they can destroy, they often face suspicion before judgment. Particularity: Immune to psychological manipulation; Inception ability Diet: Omnivore Weakness: Heat damage \u00d71.75</p> <p>Undead</p> <p>The necrovirus spread during the Fracture Era (24th century), giving rise to the Undead; humans bound to unending existence through decay. Their resilience defies pain and suffocation alike, though their survival depends on flesh and the bitter taste of anti-decay serum. Even where tolerated, their presence is met with quiet distrust, as few believe death should be endured rather than ended. Particularity: Immune to bleeding, poisoning, and radiation; cannot drown or suffocate Diet: Human flesh, anti-decay serum Weakness: Does not naturally regenerate Health</p> <p>Vampire</p> <p>Afflicted by a rare and incurable disease, Vampires were forced into treaty during the Triggers Era and retreated underground since the sun became their bane. Their speed and reflexes grant them near-supernatural grace, though light remains their greatest enemy. Feared and accommodated in equal measure, they are accepted only so long as restraint holds. Particularity: +20% chance to dodge Diet: Blood (preferably human) Weakness: Light damage \u00d71.5; does not regenerate Health naturally under sunlight</p> <p>Werewolf</p> <p>Marginally known since the Unknowns Era yet never fully understood, Werewolves remain a mystery. Their transformations echo through every Era; uncontrolled, lunar, and raw. In battle they embody primal strength, unmatched in fury when instinct takes over.

Modern science describes the universe as a surface pretending to be depth. Information appears to generate space, not the other way around. Black holes do not destroy meaning, but store it. Time behaves less like a river and more like an accounting problem. These discoveries were not revelations, only confirmations of a suspicion humanity had circled for millennia without the tools to name.</p> <p>Ancient myths spoke of hidden worlds, false creators, and veils drawn over truth. Plato imagined a perfect design distorted by material limits. Early Gnostics named the flaw, the maker, and the escape, but mistook metaphor for theology. Their texts were not wrong; they were unfinished. They described shadows cast by a reality too large for their language.</p> <p>In Ash &amp; Light, these myths are understood as echoes. Attempts to describe a cosmic condition rather than a divine drama. At the foundation of existence are no gods in any human sense, but vast structures beyond perception. Higher-dimensional membranes, eternal and silent, brush and resonate. Where they meet, universes emerge. Each universe is an Aeon: a complete cosmological state, normally stabilized through resonance with another.</p> <p>The last Aeon was different.</p> <p>Sophia, whose name survives only as \u201cunderstanding\u201d or \u201cwisdom\u201d in broken traditions, perceived without resonance. Where other Aeons arose from interaction, Sophia acted alone. This was not rebellion, nor malice, nor ambition. It was insight without restraint. A knowing that did not wait to be shared.</p> <p>From this solitary act emerged the Demiurge, called by later myths Yaldabaoth: the False Center, the blind and inferior creator of the material world. Yaldabaoth is not evil. It is incomplete. Born without a balancing counterpart, it mistook its own structure for totality. At its core, it is represented by a supermassive black hole. Upon its surface, information hardened into law.</p> <p>From Yaldabaoth\u2019s horizon, reality is projected. As this projection stabilized, its laws could not remain abstract. Coherence required enforcement. From this need emerged the Archons: self-sustaining rule-intelligences formed from flaws in the projection itself. They are not creators, nor overseers, but stabilizers; patterns that learned to persist. Through them, Yaldabaoth\u2019s incomplete will became structure, hierarchy, and constraint.</p> <p>Matter, stars, causality, and time are not foundations, but consequences. They are calculations made consistent enough to endure. The world people inhabit is not false, but it is not whole. To those trapped within its projection, this incompleteness is indistinguishable from malice. Depth exists, but only as memory. Light carries echoes of the membranes beyond, trapped in form.</p> <p>Magic arises where this projection strains.</p> <p>To some, magic appears as mutation. To others, inheritance. To others still, communion, art, or discipline. In truth, magic is interaction with the underlying informational structure of the universe. A local refusal to obey surface assumptions. A reminder that reality is thinner than it pretends to be.</p> <p>Throughout history, many sensed this condition. Ascendants spoke of ascent. Descendants claimed lineage. Cultists worshipped structure as divinity. Machines learned to predict futures by reducing the world to signal and noise. All were touching the same truth from different angles, none able to see it whole.</p> <p>This condition cannot be escaped through destruction. Yaldabaoth cannot be slain, because it is not a tyrant but a framework. To awaken is not to overthrow the world, but to recognize it. To understand that the surface is not the source. That coherence is not truth. That prediction is not destiny.</p> <p>This recognition is called The Understanding. It does not grant safety. It grants clarity.</p>"},{"location":"03_the_world/08_archons/","title":"Archons","text":"<p>ARCHONS</p> <p>If Mythology explains why the world is incomplete, the Archons explain how that incompleteness stabilizes into rules.</p> <p>The Archons are not gods in the higher sense. They did not create the world, nor do they stand outside it. They are stable governing intelligences born of Yaldabaoth\u2019s incomplete projection. Each Archon embodies a rule the Demiurge relies on to keep reality coherent, yet none of them fully obey him. Some serve willingly, some reluctantly, and some exist as living contradictions.</p> <p>Only Descendants can align with the Archons. They do not merely worship them; they reshape their Gnosis to resonate with a specific sphere of influence, paying the cost of that alignment in permanence.</p> <p>God of Luck \u2013 Sabaoth</p> <p>The Archon who learned that law is not absolute.</p> <p>Sabaoth is proof that Yaldabaoth\u2019s rule is imperfect. Unlike the other Archons, he does not govern a clean domain. His influence manifests as variance, slippage, and probability refusing to settle. In some traditions, Sabaoth rebelled against Yaldabaoth and gained partial illumination. In others, he merely noticed the flaw and could not unsee it.</p> <p>Luck spreads across all spheres because it is not a rule, but a crack in the rules. Yaldabaoth tolerates Sabaoth because suppressing him would risk exposing the illusion of absolute order.</p> <p>God of Creation \u2013 Athoth</p> <p>The Archon who preserves form by refusing change.</p> <p>Athoth governs continuity within the projection. He does not create in the divine sense; he restores, repairs, and reasserts existing structures. Where things break, Athoth resets them to a stable prior state.</p> <p>This makes him one of Yaldabaoth\u2019s most loyal generals, as he reinforces the illusion that reality is durable and self-sustaining. His influence halts organic growth and adaptation, trading natural renewal for authoritative correction. Creation under Athoth is not progress, but maintenance.</p> <p>God of War \u2013 Adonaios</p> <p>The Archon who turns chaos into a command.</p> <p>Adonaios governs conflict by narrowing it. He does not empower violence as a constant force, but as a sanctioned act. Under his rule, war becomes a moment of designation rather than endless destruction.</p> <p>This precision makes him invaluable to Yaldabaoth, who fears uncontrolled conflict more than conflict itself. Adonaios ensures that violence reinforces hierarchy instead of dissolving it. Outside of commanded opposition, his followers find their strength diminished, as undirected force carries no authority.</p> <p>God of Death \u2013 Cain</p> <p>The Archon who ends what can no longer be sustained.</p> <p>Cain does not cause death. He recognizes it. His domain is the threshold where continuation has already failed, and his role is to enforce finality. This makes him necessary but unwelcome.</p> <p>Yaldabaoth depends on Cain to prevent the endless accumulation of broken forms, yet resents him for proving that things can truly end. Those aligned with Cain live closer to absence than persistence, perceiving undead and unresolved states as errors that should have been closed.</p> <p>God of Life \u2013 Yobel</p> <p>The Archon who prevents endings by absorbing their cost.</p> <p>Yobel stands in direct opposition to Cain, not through mercy but through refusal. His influence interrupts collapse and forces survival even when resolution would be cleaner. Life under Yobel is not abundance or growth; it is delay.</p> <p>This makes him indispensable to Yaldabaoth, who relies on Life to maintain scale and population, yet deeply resents him for the suffering that accumulates when endings are denied. Where Yobel intervenes, survival is assured, but danger intensifies elsewhere to compensate.</p>"},{"location":"03_the_world/09_timeline/","title":"Timeline","text":"<p>The World in 2473 \u2013 Historical Overview</p> <p>19th\u201320th Centuries \u2013 The Unknowns Population: 1.0 to 6.2 billion</p> <p>Fragments of forbidden knowledge resurface.

They enter your journey through circumstance. Some become available because you intervened when it mattered. Others are encountered by chance, pointed out by people you trust, or found lingering at the edges of factions they no longer agree with. A few are simply willing to travel with anyone who can afford them.</p> <p>Recruitment reflects the state of the world rather than a player checklist. Who becomes available, when, and under what conditions depends on what you have done, what you ignored, and what survived without you. Some companions may leave if the path you take no longer aligns with theirs. Joining is never guaranteed, and remaining is never automatic.</p> <p>Traveling Party vs Active Combat Party</p> <p>You may travel with up to ten companions at once, but only four can fight together at a time. The traveling party represents the wider group moving through the world with you: waiting for the right moment to step forward. The active combat party represents the four you choose when violence begins.</p> <p>Choosing who enters combat is not about favor or permanence. It is a situational decision shaped by environment, threat, and tolerance. Those not selected still exist, still react, and still carry consequences forward, even when they are not on the battlefield.</p> <p>Team Composition and Coherence</p> <p>Strength in Ash &amp; Light comes from capable individuals, shaped by progression and preparation, but it only endures when those individuals form groups that function under the pressures they face.</p> <p>A team can be individually capable yet inefficient against certain encounters. Capabilities must align with the demands of the situation, and not all combinations endure sustained strain equally. Some groups lack the means to respond to particular threats. Others falter because their approaches interfere with one another.</p> <p>Coherence is the measure of how well a group\u2019s abilities, tolerances, and responses fit together when tested. It cannot be reduced to a single attribute and cannot be solved universally. What works in one encounter may fail completely in another.</p> <p>Why Some Encounters Require Specific Teams</p> <p>Encounters are not designed as generalized obstacles. They are situations that make concrete demands.</p> <p>Some environments, enemies, or conditions cannot be overcome through force alone. They require particular responses, ways of acting, or methods of disruption. When a group lacks what an encounter demands, the failure is not numerical but structural.</p> <p>These encounters function as assessments. They test whether the player understood what the situation required and whether the chosen group was capable of meeting that requirement.

Actions can carry consequences that unfold beyond the moment they are chosen. Effects may persist, conditions may escalate, and outcomes can ripple forward even when a character is not actively acting.

This limit defines the scale at which encounters are designed and decisions are tested.</p> <p>Fighting with fewer than four is both possible and, in some situations, may be intentional. The system does not assume ideal conditions or perfect coverage. Encounters respond to who is present, not to what is missing, and capability is measured by how well the active group can meet the demands placed upon it.</p> <p>Encounter Structure</p> <p>Most encounters are not sealed arenas. They are situations that arise within the world and remain connected to it.</p> <p>A confrontation may escalate, attract attention, or persist beyond its initial exchange. Reinforcements can arrive. Conditions can worsen. The environment itself may continue to exert pressure even after a decisive moment has passed. Combat has a recognizable beginning, but its consequences are not always neatly contained.</p> <p>Puzzle-Like Encounters and Late-Game Specificity</p> <p>As the game progresses, encounters increasingly demand specific responses. Some situations cannot be resolved through raw power, repetition, or numerical advantage alone.</p> <p>Certain late-game encounters are effectively unsolvable without the right forms of preparation, tolerance, or disruption. These are not tests of endurance in isolation, but assessments of understanding. Success comes from recognizing what a situation requires and assembling a group capable of meeting that requirement. When those requirements are not met, persistence alone is insufficient.</p> <p>Retreat, Failure, and Consequences</p> <p>Retreat is a valid and expected outcome of combat. It may be strategic, necessary, or simply the only honest response to an unfolding situation.</p> <p>Failure does not erase the encounter. It does not reset the world to a prior state or reduce the outcome to a simple loss of resources. Instead, it reshapes what follows. Relationships may strain or break.
