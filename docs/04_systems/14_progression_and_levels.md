**Progression (Levels & Capability)**

**Levels**

Characters in Ash & Light gain levels. Levels are visible and discrete, tracked on character sheets alongside other forms of development.

Levels mark how much strain a character can endure, how reliably they can act under threat, and what kinds of situations they can meaningfully participate in. Progression is permanent. The world does not scale itself to the player, and earlier encounters may become trivial if only found later.

This does not signal safety. It signals readiness.

**What Leveling Actually Does**

Leveling expands capability rather than guaranteeing success. As characters advance, they become more tolerant of danger, more resilient to disruption, and more capable of engaging with demanding encounters without immediate collapse.

Progression allows access to situations that would otherwise be overwhelming. It reduces the likelihood that a single mistake ends an attempt outright, but it does not remove the need for preparation, understanding, or coherent group composition. Later encounters remain uncompromising in their demands, regardless of level.

Growth in Ash & Light is not limited to the individual. As the party expands, the range of possible approaches grows exponentially. New allies introduce new combinations, responses, and strategies, reshaping how encounters can be addressed. This expansion of options is as important as numerical improvement, and often more decisive.

Levels do not solve encounters. They allow you to survive long enough to solve them.

*Progression is not about becoming safe. It is about becoming capable, and about widening the space in which meaningful choices can be made.*
