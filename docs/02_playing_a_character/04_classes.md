**Classes**

Classes define how a character approaches conflict. They shape combat roles, favored tools, and learned disciplines, but do not determine identity, origin, or allegiance. Two characters may share a class while embodying it in entirely different ways.

Each class is associated with an armor category and governs which weapons and magical disciplines can be used. Where alignment defines why a character acts, class defines how they survive the moment.
