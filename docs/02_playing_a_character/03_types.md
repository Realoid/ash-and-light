**Types**

Types define a character’s nature and origin within the world of Ash & Light. Each Type reflects how a being came to exist, whether through lineage, transformation, technology, anomaly, or survival across eras. Types shape inherent strengths, weaknesses, and special traits, influencing how characters interact with the world and its systems. A Type does not dictate morality, profession, or role in combat, but establishes the fundamental condition from which all paths and classes emerge.

**Alien**

First known contact came from the Betelgeuse system during the Expansions Era (23rd century), when coalitions between species began to form. The Alien’s mastery of subatomic matter and superior intellect make them formidable opponents, often winning through strategy and the careful reading of an enemy’s rhythm. Their detached logic inspires admiration in some and unease in others, as their decisions often feel precise rather than compassionate.
Particularity: Can teleport (with a cooldown)
Diet: Very selective, eats little, consumes electricity to maintain humanoid form
Weakness: Poison damage ×1.5; healing received ×0.9

**Ascendant**

Born of human origin, the Ascendant awakened during the Triggers Era (22nd century) as new visions and teachings revealed the deeper laws of the world. Through meditation and tireless training, they transcended common limits, achieving balance and unmatched adaptability in battle. They are often welcomed openly, though their certainty can quietly unsettle those who distrust revelation over proof.
Particularity: Attribute total ×1.2
Diet: Omnivore
Weakness: None

**Cyborg**

Engineered through early A.I. experiments of the Triggers Era and refined during the Expansions, Cyborgs combine human instinct with technological resilience. Their advanced optics pierce barriers, and their endurance allows them to outlast nearly any foe. Their reliability earns trust in moments of crisis, yet their dependence on machinery leaves others wondering where the human ends.
Particularity: Can see through walls (with a cooldown)
Diet: Omnivore, also consumes electricity
Weakness: Electric damage ×1.75

**Descendant**

Born when divine lineage resurfaced during the Triggers Era, Descendants carry traces of forgotten gods within mortal flesh. Their strength and resistance to pain surpass ordinary beings, and each channels a fragment of the power once belonging to their ancestral deity. Their presence commands respect by default, though it rarely invites ease or familiarity.
Particularity: Power depends on chosen god
Diet: Omnivore
Weakness: Determined by chosen god

**Dwarf**

Hidden through the Unknowns Era (19th–20th centuries) and rediscovered during the Expansions, Dwarves brought back their immense strength and deep-rooted craft. Descendants of ancient Neanderthal lines, they stand immovable on the battlefield and unshaken in purpose. Their constancy earns long-term trust, even when their stubbornness tests patience.
Particularity: Cannot be physically destabilized; smaller than average
Diet: Omnivore, eats heavily
Weakness: Agility ×0.85

**Elf**

Withdrawn through the Unknowns and Warnings Eras (19th–21st centuries), Elves emerged again after the Fracture to aid in rebuilding. Ageless and precise, they move with natural harmony, their kinship with living things often turning the wild itself into an ally. Their restraint and distance are admired by some and mistaken for indifference by others.
Particularity: Can command visible animals
Diet: Elven food
Weakness: Experience gained ×0.85

**Mutant**

Born from clandestine human experiments of the Warnings Era (21st century), Mutants awakened to psychic power that blurred the line between thought and action. They dominate subtle battlefields, reading or bending minds before a single strike is made. Feared more for what they can influence than what they can destroy, they often face suspicion before judgment.
Particularity: Immune to psychological manipulation; Inception ability
Diet: Omnivore
Weakness: Heat damage ×1.75

**Undead**

The necrovirus spread during the Fracture Era (24th century), giving rise to the Undead; humans bound to unending existence through decay. Their resilience defies pain and suffocation alike, though their survival depends on flesh and the bitter taste of anti-decay serum. Even where tolerated, their presence is met with quiet distrust, as few believe death should be endured rather than ended.
Particularity: Immune to bleeding, poisoning, and radiation; cannot drown or suffocate
Diet: Human flesh, anti-decay serum
Weakness: Does not naturally regenerate Health

**Vampire**

Afflicted by a rare and incurable disease, Vampires were forced into treaty during the Triggers Era and retreated underground since the sun became their bane. Their speed and reflexes grant them near-supernatural grace, though light remains their greatest enemy. Feared and accommodated in equal measure, they are accepted only so long as restraint holds.
Particularity: +20% chance to dodge
Diet: Blood (preferably human)
Weakness: Light damage ×1.5; does not regenerate Health naturally under sunlight

**Werewolf**

Marginally known since the Unknowns Era yet never fully understood, Werewolves remain a mystery. Their transformations echo through every Era; uncontrolled, lunar, and raw. In battle they embody primal strength, unmatched in fury when instinct takes over.
Particularity: Can partially transform (with a cooldown)
Diet: Carnivore, eats massive amounts
Weakness: Loses control during a full moon
