**Alignment**

Alignments represent the interpretive lens through which a character engages with the world of Ash \& Light. Rather than moral labels or fixed choices, they reflect how actions are understood, justified, and carried forward over time. Light, Ash, and Tempered paths shape how consequences unfold, how the world responds, and what meaning the player derives from their journey.

A chosen alignment must be upheld through sustained patterns of action; otherwise, it will gradually default to Tempered. Its effects become legible over time through how different factions and individuals react to you.

**LIGHT – The Path of Compassion \& Kindness**

Warmth where the world could have stayed cold.

The player seeks meaning, purpose, and elevation. They want their actions to heal, unite, or reveal beauty, even through sacrifice. The payoff is affirmation: “I made the world lighter by existing.” This is the path where emotional reward comes not only from what the player does, but from what they awaken in others.

The world subtly warms around them. NPCs make choices that feel human and surprising. Compassion is not simply “being nice”; it is seeing what kindness makes possible in a harsh world where such choices are often costly.

*How it plays out:*
Someone you helped returns to fight alongside you. A smith may later offer you an item of your choice. A frightened villager finds courage because of your example. A merchant you once defended arrives mid-battle with supplies to save your life.

**ASH – The Path of Will \& Power**

Where every obstacle becomes fuel.

The player seeks control, strength, and the clarity of acting without restraint. The payoff is mastery: “I shaped the world by will alone.” This is the path where the emotional impact is internal. The player feels strong because the world is unyielding and they push through it.

Power is not cruelty; it is momentum. It is the satisfaction of standing, acting, refusing to break. This is the path of the thought: “I didn’t think I could do this. But I did.”

*How it plays out:*
Killing someone may grant you their loot and the key to their home. Killing a merchant allows you to take everything they owned. A shop becomes a vault. A camp becomes a resource point. But they will never forgive you, and their allies may become your enemies later.

**TEMPERED – The Path of Insight \& Awe**

Witnessing patterns and truths that do not announce themselves.

The player finds satisfaction in adaptability, in seeing multiple sides, in surviving where ideologues fall. The payoff is comprehension: “I learned what others could not see.” The emotional reward here is quiet clarity. Sudden understanding. Beauty revealed like a pattern emerging from noise.

Insight manifests as the hush before revelation: eclipses, resonance, shimmer. Moments where the world feels intelligent, and the player realizes they are listening.

*How it plays out:*
You receive extra clues through writing or an inner voice while exploring. These insights lead to places others never find. You may gain loot, but you always gain access: hidden routes, forgotten temples, and entire vistas no one else realizes exist.
