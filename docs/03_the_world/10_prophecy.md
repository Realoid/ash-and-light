**The Prophecy**

The prophecy that surfaces in the final centuries is not a single text, nor a shared creed. It appears fractured across families, species, and traditions, each carrying a fragment shaped by fear or hope. Its core, however, is consistent.

It speaks of a time when coherence tightens too far. When systems learn faster than lives can adapt. When futures narrow until only repetition remains. When Yaldabaoth’s projection becomes so efficient that deviation itself is threatened.

In that moment, the prophecy says, the world does not end. It fractures again.

Not through fire alone, nor invasion, nor plague, but through choice. Through alliances that should not form. Through failures that do not reset. Through small deviations no system can fully anticipate.

Cinder Island is named again and again in these fragments. Not as a throne or sanctuary, but as a convergence point. A place where resonance might be restored, or collapse made final. The prophecy offers no victor. No promised salvation.

Only this:

When the surface believes itself complete and the center declares itself final,
the smallest of unmodeled choices can decide which future survives.

*Your journey begins there.*
