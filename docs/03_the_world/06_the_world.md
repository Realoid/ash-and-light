**THE WORLD**

The world carries its history forward. Myths, timelines, and prophecies are fragments left behind by earlier fractures, attempts at order, and moments when resolution failed. These layers do not exist to explain everything or to guide events toward a promised outcome. They form a living context that shapes how places, peoples, and systems behave in the present. Understanding the world means recognizing how past choices still echo, and how what survived continues to shape what can happen next.

Actions in Ash & Light rarely end where they occur. What happens in one place tends to circulate through others, carried by rumor, absence, displaced people, shifting trade, and altered behavior. Districts are not sealed containers; they listen imperfectly to one another, reacting late, unevenly, and sometimes inaccurately. The same event may harden suspicion in one area, invite opportunity in another, or pass almost unnoticed elsewhere. Over time, these accumulated impressions shape how player groups are received, resisted, or quietly avoided. Even when no one addresses the player directly, the world is still paying attention, and it adjusts itself accordingly.
