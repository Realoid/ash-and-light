**Game Description**

Ash & Light is a consequence-driven, turn-based RPG set in a world that does not reset itself around the player. There is no central script guiding events toward comfort or resolution. Actions persist. Loss carries forward. The world remembers what you did, what you failed to do, and who you chose to rely on.

Exploration is slow and deliberate. You move through settlements, ruins, wilderness, and contested spaces as an observer first and an actor second, learning the world through fragments, reactions, and pressure rather than exposition. Information is incomplete by design. Comprehension comes from paying attention, returning changed, and surviving long enough to recognize patterns.

Over time, you gather allies. Not recruits to optimize, but people with limits, histories, and ways of acting in the world. You may travel with many, but only a few can fight at your side at any given moment. Choosing who stands together is as important as how they act once combat begins.

Combat is turn-based and unforgiving, emphasizing preparation, positioning, and coherence over reflex. Encounters are not solved through repetition alone. They are puzzles that ask different questions as the game progresses. Early on, flexibility matters. Later, understanding matters more. Certain enemies can only be overcome by specific combinations of roles, capabilities, and tolerances. Toward the end, victory may require not just the right strategy, but the right people.

Progression is not about becoming safe. It is about becoming capable. Characters begin fragile and uncertain, relying on restraint, improvisation, and one another. Capability emerges through loss, adaptation, and learning what fits together under pressure. Power is never free, and specialization closes as many doors as it opens.

You act through compassion, will, or insight. These are not moral choices presented as answers, but interpretive lenses through which the world responds. Allies react. Factions shift indirectly. Consequences surface late, unevenly, and sometimes far from where they were set in motion.

Logistics are handled quietly. Resources are gathered, interpreted, and transformed through others, not through inventory management or personal mastery. What matters is less about how or what you collected but more to do with what the world can trade or craft with what you found.

*Ash & Light is not a game about clean victories or optimal paths. It is about endurance, composition, and learning how to exist in a world that does not explain itself, but responds honestly to those who remain.*
