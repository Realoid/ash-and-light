Ash & Light — Codex

The Codex is the public world, systems, and philosophy reference for Ash & Light, an original video game in development. It is written as a living document, not a manual.

*Ash & Light* is being developed by a small independent team of two, with systems and ideas documented as they take shape. These pages exist to make the world legible, shareable, and open to discussion as it grows.
